# 🌞 Dynamic Dashboard Greeting

## ✅ Feature Implemented
**Goal:** Replace the static "Welcome Back" message with a time-sensitive greeting (Good morning/afternoon/evening).

**Implementation:**
- 🕒 **Time Detection:** Added logic to check the user's local time.
- 💬 **Dynamic Text:**
  - **Morning (< 12 PM):** "Good morning"
  - **Afternoon (12 PM - 6 PM):** "Good afternoon"
  - **Evening (> 6 PM):** "Good evening"
- 👤 **Personalization:** Keeps the user's name (e.g., "Good evening, Dushimirimana").

## 🚀 How to Verify
1. **Go to the Dashboard.**
2. **Check the Header:** You should see the greeting matching your current time.
   - *Example:* If it's 9 PM, it should say "Good evening, [Your Name]".

**Your dashboard now feels more personal and responsive!** 👋
