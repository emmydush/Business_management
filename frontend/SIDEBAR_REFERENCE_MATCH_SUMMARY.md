# 🎨 Sidebar Redesign: Reference Match

## ✅ Design Implemented
**Goal:** Match the sidebar design to the provided reference image.

**Key Features:**
- 💊 **Active Pill:** The active menu item (e.g., "Business") is now a large, glowing purple pill.
- 👻 **Transparent Inactive:** Inactive items have no background, keeping the look clean.
- 🟣 **Submenu Style:** Submenu items are indented with a vertical line; active ones have a dark purple background.
- 🚪 **Logout Section:** The bottom area is darker and spacious, framing the logout button.

## 🚀 How to Verify
1. **Refresh the Page.**
2. **Compare with Image:**
   - The active item should look just like the "Business" button in your screenshot.
   - The overall feel should be dark, modern, and spacious.

**Your sidebar now matches the design you wanted!** ✨
