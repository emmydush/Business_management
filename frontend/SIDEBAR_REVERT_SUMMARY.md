# 🔙 Sidebar Revert: Original Design

## ✅ Design Restored
**Goal:** Revert the sidebar to its original design while keeping the new Logout button.

**Restored Features:**
- 🖌️ **Original Gradient:** The classic deep purple/navy background.
- 🔲 **Standard Corners:** Navigation items have `8px` rounded corners (not pill-shaped).
- 📏 **Classic Active State:** Active items have a subtle background and a left indicator line.
- 📂 **Simple Submenus:** Clean indentation without extra guide lines.

**Note:** The **Logout Button** remains in place of the profile info, as requested earlier.

## 🚀 How to Verify
1. **Refresh the Page.**
2. **Check the Sidebar:** It should look like it did before the recent design experiments (no pill shapes, no glass effect).

**The sidebar is back to its classic look!** 🏛️
