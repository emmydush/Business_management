# 📊 Chart Fixes Summary

## ✅ Issues Resolved
**Problem:**
1. **Missing Titles:** Some charts had no titles (likely due to missing translations).
2. **Monochrome Chart:** The "Top Selling Products" chart was all blue.
3. **Missing Labels:** The horizontal bar chart showed numbers (0, 1, 2) instead of product names.

**Fix:**
- 🏷️ **Added Titles:** Added fallback text so "Revenue vs Expenses" and "Top Selling Products" always appear.
- 🎨 **Vibrant Colors:** Applied a multi-color palette to the "Top Selling Products" chart (Indigo, Purple, Pink, etc.).
- 📉 **Fixed Axes:** Corrected the chart configuration so product names appear on the left and numbers appear on the bottom.

## 🚀 How to Verify
1. **Refresh the Dashboard.**
2. **Check Titles:** Verify that both bottom charts have bold titles.
3. **Check Colors:** The "Top Selling Products" chart should now have colorful bars.
4. **Check Labels:** You should see product names (e.g., "Product A", "Product B") listed on the left side of the horizontal chart.

**Your charts are now beautiful and informative!** 📈
