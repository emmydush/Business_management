# 📋 Recent Activities Restored

## ✅ Issue Resolved
**Problem:** The "Recent Activities" section was missing from the dashboard after the file restoration.

**Fix:**
- 🔙 **Restored Section:** Added the "Recent Activities" table back to the bottom of the dashboard.
- 📅 **Date Formatting:** Imported `moment.js` to correctly display timestamps (e.g., "Jan 19, 2026 10:00 PM").
- 👤 **User Info:** Displays the user avatar and name for each activity.

## 🚀 How to Verify
1. **Refresh the Dashboard.**
2. **Scroll Down:** You should now see a "Recent Activity" card at the bottom.
3. **Check Content:** It should list recent actions (if any) with details and timestamps.

**Your dashboard content is now complete!** ✅
