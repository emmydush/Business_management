# 🚑 Dashboard Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved
**Problem:** The `Dashboard.js` file was corrupted during the previous update, causing a syntax error (`ES2015 named imports do not destructure`) and missing component logic.

**Fix:**
- 🔄 **Full Restoration:** Completely rewrote `src/pages/Dashboard.js` with the correct code structure.
- 🧹 **Cleaned Imports:** Removed the invalid code from the import section.
- ✨ **Feature Preserved:** Ensured the **Dynamic Greeting with Icons** (Sun/Moon) is correctly implemented.

## 🚀 How to Verify
1. **Refresh the Dashboard.**
2. **Check for Errors:** The "Compiled with problems" error screen should be gone.
3. **Verify Greeting:** You should see the greeting with the icon (e.g., 🌙 Good evening).

**The dashboard is back online and fully functional!** ✅
