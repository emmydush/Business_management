-- Database initialization script for business management system

-- Create the database (this is handled by POSTGRES_DB environment variable, but included for completeness)
-- CREATE DATABASE all_inone;

-- The tables will be created by the Flask app's db.create_all() call

-- Create a default superadmin user
-- This will be handled by the Flask app during initialization

-- Any additional initialization commands can go here
-- For now, we'll keep it simple as the Flask app handles table creation
